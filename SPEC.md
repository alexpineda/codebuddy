# Project Specification

This project involves a **file-based session** approach where each session is uniquely identified and references its own directory for screenshots and a **text-based log** of annotations. Each new session is created on demand, storing **metadata** such as the user-specified interval for captures, plus the timestamp of each screenshot. When the session ends, the user can either pause or resume capturing at will, and a **clear/reset** function can terminate the current session and initiate a new one. Each session directory remains isolated from others for privacy and simplicity.

Users interact with the system via a **command line interface** that accepts an interval argument and immediately starts capturing screenshots at the specified frequency. The **text logs** are appended with description data about each capture, serving as a simple but comprehensive record of user activity. The user can request a pause to ask questions about the log. The program also provides an option to exit gracefully.

A potential **website** can expose these capabilities through a front-end that connects to the same Python scripts. The site could allow starting, pausing, and resuming sessions, as well as reviewing text logs in real time. A user could easily clear/reset sessions using a single interface control. The interval would still be configured at startup but could be dynamically updated if desired. A server-side framework such as **Flask** or **Django** can bridge the front-end to the core Python logic. Each session folder would remain intact, and references to them would be tracked in a central but minimal configuration file. This preserves privacy by preventing accidental mixing of data between sessions.

A **privacy_lllm** mode can precede any external calls to services like **OpenAI** by using a **local model** that scans or redacts sensitive information before sending the screenshot data out. This ensures no personally identifiable content inadvertently leaves the userâ€™s machine. Voice chat can run in the background using a continuous recording process, while suggestions or assistance could be surfaced through notifications or prompts. The system should aim to be minimally intrusive, only surfacing automated help or background activity when the user explicitly requests it or in a low-key notification area. This approachable design keeps the workflow uncluttered while remaining open for future enhancements such as **active assistance** or deeper **AI-driven** insights.
